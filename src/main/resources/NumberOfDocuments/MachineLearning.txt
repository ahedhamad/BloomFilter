Introduction to Spark MLlib
MLlib is Spark's machine learning (ML) library makes the implementation of different machine learning algorithms scalable and easy. The main features of MLlib can be summarized as follows:
ML Algorithms: common learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering
Featurization: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection
Pipelines: tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines
Persistence: saving and load algorithms, models, and Pipelines

Transformers, estimators, and pipelines:
First, let's start with ML Pipelines. ML Pipelines provide a uniform set of high-level APIs built on top of DataFrames allowing users to create and tune practical machine learning pipelines.
Transformer: A Transformer is an algorithm which can transform one DataFrame into another DataFrame. E.g., an ML model is a Transformer which transforms a DataFrame with features into a DataFrame with predictions.
Estimator: An Estimator is an algorithm which can be fit on a DataFrame to produce a Transformer. E.g., a learning algorithm is an Estimator which trains on a DataFrame and produces a model.
Pipeline: A Pipeline chains multiple Transformers and Estimators together to specify an ML workflow.
